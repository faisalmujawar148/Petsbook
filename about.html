                  <p>We are a team of 3 students from GEMS Milennium School, Sharjah. We have created this website with an agenda to make social interactions between pet-owners much more easier, espeically during these trying times.</div>
                  <h1>Why?</h1></div>
                  <p>Pets need love from around the world, that's why we've created this haven, where pet lovers can meet up (virtually) and post videos/images/gifs of their pets! During this pandemic, many pet owners and their pets haven't been able to socialize much outside, so by creating this platform, we're giving them another mean, through which they can!</p></div>
